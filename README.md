Internships for Students
Tasks: 
Design and develop a web application (in PHP), which will be an internship portal similar to that of Internshala, but on a much smaller scale. 
 
- The application will have 2 kinds of users, student and employer.
- After registering, the employer should be able to post internships, with bare minimum details. Internship posting should be restricted only to an employer and a student as well as a non registered user, should not be allowed.
- There should be a page which should display all the internships being posted on the application. This page should be accessible to everyone irrespective of whether the user is even logged in.
- A student should be able to apply to any internship he may want. If the student has already applied for an internship, he should be restricted from applying again. If the user is not logged in, it should redirect to the login page. And if the user is logged in as an employer, he should not be allowed to apply.
- The employer should be able to see all the application he has received for his internships.
 
Mainly, we want you to concentrate on the following things:
 
- Database design
- Good coding practices
- Very basic decent design
 
Deadline: please submit your assignment latest by 19th October (Wednesday) 12:00 PM.
